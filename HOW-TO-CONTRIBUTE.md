# How to contribute?
## Code contributions

### Choose a task
1. Navigate to [Appwish task board](https://github.com/orgs/appwish/projects/1).
2. You'll see "To do" column on the left with some tasks.
3. Any task that is in the "To do" column may be picked up by anyone. If you found something for you, drag and drop the card to the next column.
4. Assign yourself to the task:
- click on task title
- a new panel will appear on right-hand side
- click "assign yourself"
5. Voila! Now you can work on your task. Fork the repository that needs the work and do your stuff.

### Open a pull request
When you're done, open a new pull request with your proposed changes.
In pull request description, put the related issue number and one of the github keywords i.e. "fixes #23"
You can find the list of all keywords here: [keywords](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords)

Adding the issue number with keyword will automate closing issues and moving cards to "Done" on project task board.

### Wait for review and feedback
When you open a pull request, it will soon appear in "In review" column on the task board. You'll have to wait 
until one of the contributors reviews the pull request and approves (or asks you for changes).

## New ideas
If you have any idea related to the project you can open an issue in one of the repositories. You can also propose changes on Slack channels or DM me on Slack @Patryk Jeziorowski.
